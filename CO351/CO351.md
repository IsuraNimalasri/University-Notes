Network theory deals with modelling problems using directed graphs, extending CS239. Network flow theory deals with flow problems over these directed graphs. A typical problem: given so-and-so network of roads (directed graph), each with different widths (cost of taking a road), how much traffic can we route from point A to B? Essentially, we're extending linear programming concepts from CO250 to directed graphs.

Real examples of networks: water pipes, electrical grid, and road networks.

Graph theory review: a **graph** is a pair of a set of vertices (arbitrary objects) and a set of edges, which are unordered pairs of vertices. The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, denoted $d_G(v)$. A **walk** is a sequence of vertices in a graph where consecutive vertices are edges in the graph. A **path** is a walk with no repeated vertices or edges. A graph is **connected** if and only if there is a path between any two vertices. A **cycle** is a walk where the last vertex is the same as the first vertex. A **cut induced by a set of vertices $S$** is the set of edges with one end in $S$ and another end not in $S$, denoted $\delta(S)$. The size of a cut is denoted $d(S)$ or $\abs{\delta(S)}$. A tree is a connected acyclic graph.

Theorem: there's an $s, t$-path in $G$ if and only if for all $X \subseteq V(G)$ such that $s \in X, t \notin X$, $\delta(X) \ne \emptyset$ - exactly when every subset of vertices including $s$ but not $t$ has a non-empty cut.

Proof:

> First we'll prove the forward direction. Assume an $s, t$-path exists. Let $v_0, \ldots, v_k$ be one of those $s, t$-paths, let $X \subseteq V(G)$ be an arbitrary subset of graph vertices such that $s \in X, t \notin X$.  
> Let $i$ be the smallest index in the $s, t$-path such that $v_i \notin X$. Since it's the smallest index, $v_{i - 1}$ must be in $X$, so $v_{i - 1} v_i \in \delta(X)$, so $\delta(X)$ is non-empty, as required.  
> Now for the opposite direction. Assume no $s, t$-path exists. Then $s$ and $t$ are in two different components $A$ and $B$, since otherwise the path would exist.  
> Clearly, the cut induced by $A$ must be empty, since if it isn't, then any vertex in the edges of the cut that weren't in $A$ should be in $A$.  

Let $T$ be a tree. Then $\abs{E(T)} = \abs{V(T)} - 1$. Also, a unique path exists between any two vertices, and adding any edge that doesn't already exist to $T$ will form exactly one cycle, Removing any edge from that resulting cycle gives us a tree again.

Directed graphs (digraphs) are very similar to graphs. A digraph $D = \tup{N, A}$ is a pair of a set of nodes (arbitrary objects) and a set of arcs, which are ordered pairs of nodes. Each node has an **in-degree** (number of arcs that point to it) denoted $d(\overline v)$ or $d^-(v)$, and an **out-degree** (number of args that point from it) denoted $d(v)$ or $d^+(v)$. A diwalk is a sequence of nodes such that consecutive nodes have arcs between them, a dipath is a directed walk with no duplicated nodes or arcs, and a dicycle is a dipath such that the first and last nodes are the same.

Directed graphs can have cycles of length 2, unlike undirected graphs. A directed graph is acyclic if there are no dicycles. We can also talk about cycles in a directed graph, which are simply the cycles if we ignore directions in the graph.

If every node of a digraph has out-degree of at least 1, the digraph must have a directed cycle. Proof: let $v_0, \ldots, v_k$ be the longest dipath in the digraph. Clearly, $v_k$ has out-degree at least 1, so it has an arc pointing to another node $u$. Clearly, $u$ must be in the dipath, since if it wasn't then the path could be strictly longer, which isn't possible since the dipath is already the longest. So $u$ must be in the dipath, and this forms a directed cycle in the digraph.

Likewise for an undirected graphs, if every vertex has degree at least 2, there must be an undirected cycle. We can prove this in a very similar way.

A digraph is **connected** exactly when its corresponding undirected graph is connected - if every vertex in the underlying graph has a path to every other, ignoring direction. A digraph is **strongly connected** exactly when every node has a directed path to every other node.

For any subset of notes $S \subseteq N$, the **cut induced by $S$** is the set $\delta(S) = \set{xy \in A \middle| x \in S, y \notin S}$ - the set of arcs that go outward from $S$. There's also $\delta(\overline S)$, which is the set of arcs that go inward toward $S$ (the cut induced by the complement).

Just like for an undirected graph, an $s, t$-dipath exists if and only if every $s, t$-cut is non-empty. The proof is very similar to the version for undirected graphs.

Transshipment problem
---------------------

Suppose we have a network consisting of a digraph, and some objects called **supplies/goods** present at various nodes (nodes are labelled with the net quantity demanded). We want to transport goods from where there's a negative net quantity demanded to where there's a positive net quantity demanded. The quantity we transport along the arcs is the flow. In other words, **a flow is a weighting for each arc in a digraph**, representing how much of a quantity we're transporting along that arc.

The **inflow of a node** is the sum of the weights of the arcs going into the node. The **outflow of a node** the sum of the weights of the arcs leaving the node. Inflow minus outflow is the weight of the vertex - the net quantity demanded.

There are also **costs** associated with letting goods flow through an arc. A **cost** is a edge weighting, just like a flow, but the weight of an edge represents the cost of transporting one unit of a good through that arc.

The goal of the problem is to find a flow such that the net quantity demanded becomes non-positive, such that we minimize the cost of that flow.

New notation: $\vec o \in \mb{R}^S$, where $S$ is a set, means that $o$ is a vector with $\magn{S}$ elements, each one representing an element $s$ of $S$. Additionally, we can write the element corresponding to $s$ as $o_s$.

Formally: suppose we have a digraph $D = \tup{N, A}$, a node weighting $\vec b \in \mb{R}^N$ (the net quantity demanded of the good at each node in $N$), and an arc weighting $\vec w \in \mb{R}^A$ (the cost of transporting a unit of the good through each arc in $A$). A **flow** is an arc weighting $\vec x \in \mb{R}^A$ such that $\vec x \ge \vec 0$ and $\sum_{iv \in A} x_{iv} - \sum_{vj \in A} x_{vj} = b_v$ for all $v \in N$ (total inflow minus total outflow is equal to $b_v$ for any $v \in N$). The problem is to minimize $\sum_{ij \in A} w_{ij} x_{ij}$.

Intuitively, a flow problem on a digraph tries to move positive quantities of goods along arcs from nodes that are negative to nodes that are positive.

If $b_v$ is positive for a node $v$, then $v$ is a supply node. If it's negative, $v$ is a demand node.

New notation: if $N \subseteq S$, then $o(N) = \sum_{v \in N} o_v$. In other words, if we call a vector like a function with a set of indices, we get back the sum of the elements at those indices.

Therefore, $\sum_{iv \in A} x_{iv} - \sum_{vj \in A} x_{vj} = b_v$$ is equivalent to $x(\delta(\overline v)) - x(\delta(v)) = b_v$ for all $v \in N$.

Additional assumptions for network flow problems in this course:

* The digraph $D$ is connected.
* The weights are all positive - $\vec w \ge \vec 0$.
* The total quantity demanded is equal to the total quantity supplied (sum of net demands in 0) - $b(N) = 0$.

The transshipment problem can be solved simply using linear programming. The general form of the LP is: "minimize $\sum_{ij \in A} w_{ij} x_{ij}$ subject to $\sum_{iv \in A} x_{iv} - \sum_{vj \in A} x_{vj} = b_v$ for all $v \in N$, $\vec x \ge \vec 0$" (the values of $\vec w$ and $\vec b$ are fixed). In other words, **we're minimizing the total cost of performing the shipments such that we still manage to make inflow minus outflow equal to the net quantity demanded for each individual node**.

In matrix form, the columns are indexed by arcs, and the rows are indexed by nodes. At a given row $a$ and column $ab$ within the matrix, we put a 0 when there's no such arc, 1 if the digraph contains the arc $ba$, and -1 if the digraph contains the arc $ab$.

Formally, an **incidence matrix** for a digraph $D = \tup{N, A}$ is an $\abs{N}$ by $\abs{A}$ matrix $M$ where $M_{v, ij} = \begin{cases} -1 &\text{if } v = i \\ 1 &\text{if } v = j \\ 0 &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$. As it turns out, the matrix form of the LP for the transshipment problem will always have a coefficients matrix that is the incidence matrix of the digraph, under the assumptions we make for this course.

Therefore, we can write the LP more simply as "minimize $\vec w \cdot \vec x$ subject to $M \vec x = \vec b$, $\vec x \ge \vec 0$", where $M$ is the incidence matrix for the digraph.

Interestingly, since in an incidence matrix, every column of $M$ has exactly one 1 and one -1, or is all 0. Therefore, the sum of all the rows in the matrix gives $\vec 0$. If we sum the $A \vec x = \vec b$, we get $b(N) = 0$ - our assumption that the total net quantity demanded is 0.

Consider now the dual for the LP: "minimize $\vec b \cdot \vec y$ subject to $M^T \le \vec c$ for all $ij \in A$, $\vec y$ free", where $M$ is the incidence matrix for the digraph. We can then use complementary slackness to show that the LP is optimal.
