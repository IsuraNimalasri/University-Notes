Network theory deals with modelling problems using directed graphs, extending CS239. Network flow theory deals with flow problems over these directed graphs. A typical problem: given so-and-so network of roads (directed graph), each with different widths (cost of taking a road), how much traffic can we route from point A to B? Essentially, we're extending linear programming concepts from CO250 to directed graphs.

Real examples of networks: water pipes, electrical grid, and road networks.

Graph theory review: a **graph** is a pair of a set of vertices (arbitrary objects) and a set of edges, which are unordered pairs of vertices. The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, denoted $d_G(v)$. A **walk** is a sequence of vertices in a graph where consecutive vertices are edges in the graph. A **path** is a walk with no repeated vertices or edges. A graph is **connected** if and only if there is a path between any two vertices. A **cycle** is a walk where the last vertex is the same as the first vertex. A **cut induced by a set of vertices $S$** is the set of edges with one end in $S$ and another end not in $S$, denoted $\delta(S)$. The size of a cut is denoted $d(S)$ or $\abs{\delta(S)}$. A tree is a connected acyclic graph.

Theorem: there's an $s, t$-path in $G$ if and only if for all $X \subseteq V(G)$ such that $s \in X, t \notin X$, $\delta(X) \ne \emptyset$ - exactly when every subset of vertices including $s$ but not $t$ has a non-empty cut.

Proof:

> First we'll prove the forward direction. Assume an $s, t$-path exists. Let $v_0, \ldots, v_k$ be one of those $s, t$-paths, let $X \subleteq V(G)$ be an arbitrary subset of graph vertices such that $s \in X, t \notin X$.  
> Let $i$ be the smallest index in the $s, t$-path such that $v_i \notin X$. Since it's the smallest index, $v_{i - 1}$ must be in $X$, so $v_{i - 1} v_i \in \delta(X)$, so $\delta(X)$ is non-empty, as required.  
> Now for the opposite direction. Assume no $s, t$-path exists. Then $s$ and $t$ are in two different components $A$ and $B$, since otherwise the path would exist.  
> Clearly, the cut induced by $A$ must be empty, since if it isn't, then any vertex in the edges of the cut that weren't in $A$ should be in $A$.  

Let $T$ be a tree. Then $\abs{E(T)} = \abs{V(T)} - 1$. Also, a unique path exists between any two vertices, and adding any edge that doesn't already exist to $T$ will form exactly one cycle, Removing any edge from that resulting cycle gives us a tree again.

Directed graphs (digraphs) are very similar to graphs. A digraph $D = \tup{N, A}$ is a pair of a set of nodes (arbitrary objects) and a set of arcs, which are ordered pairs of nodes. Each node has an **in-degree** (number of arcs that point to it) denoted $d(\overline v)$ or $d^-(v)$, and an **out-degree** (number of args that point from it) denoted $d(v)$ or $d^+(v)$.
