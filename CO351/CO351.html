<p>Network theory deals with modelling problems using directed graphs, extending CS239. Network flow theory deals with flow problems over these directed graphs. A typical problem: given so-and-so network of roads (directed graph), each with different widths (cost of taking a road), how much traffic can we route from point A to B? Essentially, we're extending linear programming concepts from CO250 to directed graphs.</p>
<p>Real examples of networks: water pipes, electrical grid, and road networks.</p>
<p>Graph theory review: a <strong>graph</strong> is a pair of a set of vertices (arbitrary objects) and a set of edges, which are unordered pairs of vertices. The <strong>degree</strong> of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, denoted <span class="math inline">d_G(v)</span>. A <strong>walk</strong> is a sequence of vertices in a graph where consecutive vertices are edges in the graph. A <strong>path</strong> is a walk with no repeated vertices or edges. A graph is <strong>connected</strong> if and only if there is a path between any two vertices. A <strong>cycle</strong> is a walk where the last vertex is the same as the first vertex. A <strong>cut induced by a set of vertices <span class="math inline">S</span></strong> is the set of edges with one end in <span class="math inline">S</span> and another end not in <span class="math inline">S</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\delta(S)</span>. The size of a cut is denoted <span class="math inline">d(S)</span> or <span class="math inline">\abs{\delta(S)}</span>. A tree is a connected acyclic graph.</p>
<p>Theorem: there's an <span class="math inline">s, t</span>-path in <span class="math inline">G</span> if and only if for all <span class="math inline">X \subseteq V(G)</span> such that <span class="math inline">s \in X, t \notin X</span>, <span class="math inline">\delta(X) \ne \emptyset</span> - exactly when every subset of vertices including <span class="math inline">s</span> but not <span class="math inline">t</span> has a non-empty cut.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First we'll prove the forward direction. Assume an <span class="math inline">s, t</span>-path exists. Let <span class="math inline">v_0, \ldots, v_k</span> be one of those <span class="math inline">s, t</span>-paths, let <span class="math inline">X \subseteq V(G)</span> be an arbitrary subset of graph vertices such that <span class="math inline">s \in X, t \notin X</span>.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">i</span> be the smallest index in the <span class="math inline">s, t</span>-path such that <span class="math inline">v_i \notin X</span>. Since it's the smallest index, <span class="math inline">v_{i - 1}</span> must be in <span class="math inline">X</span>, so <span class="math inline">v_{i - 1} v_i \in \delta(X)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\delta(X)</span> is non-empty, as required.<br />
Now for the opposite direction. Assume no <span class="math inline">s, t</span>-path exists. Then <span class="math inline">s</span> and <span class="math inline">t</span> are in two different components <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span>, since otherwise the path would exist.<br />
Clearly, the cut induced by <span class="math inline">A</span> must be empty, since if it isn't, then any vertex in the edges of the cut that weren't in <span class="math inline">A</span> should be in <span class="math inline">A</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">T</span> be a tree. Then <span class="math inline">\abs{E(T)} = \abs{V(T)} - 1</span>. Also, a unique path exists between any two vertices, and adding any edge that doesn't already exist to <span class="math inline">T</span> will form exactly one cycle, Removing any edge from that resulting cycle gives us a tree again.</p>
<p>Directed graphs (digraphs) are very similar to graphs. A digraph <span class="math inline">D = \tup{N, A}</span> is a pair of a set of nodes (arbitrary objects) and a set of arcs, which are ordered pairs of nodes. Each node has an <strong>in-degree</strong> (number of arcs that point to it) denoted <span class="math inline">d(\overline v)</span> or <span class="math inline">d^-(v)</span>, and an <strong>out-degree</strong> (number of args that point from it) denoted <span class="math inline">d(v)</span> or <span class="math inline">d^+(v)</span>. A diwalk is a sequence of nodes such that consecutive nodes have arcs between them, a dipath is a directed walk with no duplicated nodes or arcs, and a dicycle is a dipath such that the first and last nodes are the same.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">11/9/17</h1>
<p>Directed graphs can have cycles of length 2, unlike undirected graphs. A directed graph is acyclic if there are no dicycles. We can also talk about cycles in a directed graph, which are simply the cycles if we ignore directions in the graph.</p>
<p>If every node of a digraph has out-degree of at least 1, the digraph must have a directed cycle. Proof: let <span class="math inline">v_0, \ldots, v_k</span> be the longest dipath in the digraph. Clearly, <span class="math inline">v_k</span> has out-degree at least 1, so it has an arc pointing to another node <span class="math inline">u</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">u</span> must be in the dipath, since if it wasn't then the path could be strictly longer, which isn't possible since the dipath is already the longest. So <span class="math inline">u</span> must be in the dipath, and this forms a directed cycle in the digraph.</p>
<p>Likewise for an undirected graphs, if every vertex has degree at least 2, there must be an undirected cycle. We can prove this in a very similar way.</p>
<p>A digraph is <strong>connected</strong> exactly when its corresponding undirected graph is connected - if every vertex in the underlying graph has a path to every other, ignoring direction. A digraph is <strong>strongly connected</strong> exactly when every node has a directed path to every other node.</p>
<p>For any subset of notes <span class="math inline">S \subseteq N</span>, the <strong>cut induced by <span class="math inline">S</span></strong> is the set <span class="math inline">\delta(S) = \set{xy \in A \middle| x \in S, y \notin S}</span> - the set of arcs that go outward from <span class="math inline">S</span>. There's also <span class="math inline">\delta(\overline S)</span>, which is the set of arcs that go inward toward <span class="math inline">S</span> (the cut induced by the complement).</p>
<p>Just like for an undirected graph, an <span class="math inline">s, t</span>-dipath exists if and only if every <span class="math inline">s, t</span>-cut is non-empty. The proof is very similar to the version for undirected graphs.</p>
<h2 id="transshipment-problem">Transshipment problem</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a network consisting of a digraph, and some objects called <strong>supplies/goods</strong> present at various nodes (nodes are labelled with the net quantity demanded). We want to transport goods from where there's a negative net quantity demanded to where there's a positive net quantity demanded. The quantity we transport along the arcs is the flow. In other words, <strong>a flow is a weighting for each arc in a digraph</strong>, representing how much of a quantity we're transporting along that arc.</p>
<p>The <strong>inflow of a node</strong> is the sum of the weights of the arcs going into the node. The <strong>outflow of a node</strong> the sum of the weights of the arcs leaving the node. Inflow minus outflow is the weight of the vertex - the net quantity demanded.</p>
<p>There are also <strong>costs</strong> associated with letting goods flow through an arc. A <strong>cost</strong> is a edge weighting, just like a flow, but the weight of an edge represents the cost of transporting one unit of a good through that arc.</p>
<p>The goal of the problem is to find a flow such that the net quantity demanded becomes non-positive, such that we minimize the cost of that flow.</p>
<p>New notation: <span class="math inline">\vec o \in \mb{R}^S</span>, where <span class="math inline">S</span> is a set, means that <span class="math inline">o</span> is a vector with <span class="math inline">\magn{S}</span> elements, each one representing an element <span class="math inline">s</span> of <span class="math inline">S</span>. Additionally, we can write the element corresponding to <span class="math inline">s</span> as <span class="math inline">o_s</span>.</p>
<p>Formally: suppose we have a digraph <span class="math inline">D = \tup{N, A}</span>, a node weighting <span class="math inline">\vec b \in \mb{R}^N</span> (the net quantity demanded of the good at each node in <span class="math inline">N</span>), and an arc weighting <span class="math inline">\vec w \in \mb{R}^A</span> (the cost of transporting a unit of the good through each arc in <span class="math inline">A</span>). A <strong>flow</strong> is an arc weighting <span class="math inline">\vec x \in \mb{R}^A</span> such that <span class="math inline">\vec x \ge \vec 0</span> and <span class="math inline">\sum_{iv \in A} x_{iv} - \sum_{vj \in A} x_{vj} = b_v</span> for all <span class="math inline">v \in N</span> (total inflow minus total outflow is equal to <span class="math inline">b_v</span> for any <span class="math inline">v \in N</span>). The problem is to minimize <span class="math inline">\sum_{ij \in A} w_{ij} x_{ij}</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">13/9/17</h1>
<p>Intuitively, a flow problem on a digraph tries to move positive quantities of goods along arcs from nodes that are negative to nodes that are positive.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">b_v</span> is positive for a node <span class="math inline">v</span>, then <span class="math inline">v</span> is a supply node. If it's negative, <span class="math inline">v</span> is a demand node.</p>
<p>New notation: if <span class="math inline">N \subseteq S</span>, then <span class="math inline">o(N) = \sum_{v \in N} o_v</span>. In other words, if we call a vector like a function with a set of indices, we get back the sum of the elements at those indices.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\sum_{iv \in A} x_{iv} - \sum_{vj \in A} x_{vj} = b_v</span>$ is equivalent to <span class="math inline">x(\delta(\overline v)) - x(\delta(v)) = b_v</span> for all <span class="math inline">v \in N</span>.</p>
<p>Additional assumptions for network flow problems in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>The digraph <span class="math inline">D</span> is connected.</li>
<li>The weights are all positive - <span class="math inline">\vec w \ge \vec 0</span>.</li>
<li>The total quantity demanded is equal to the total quantity supplied (sum of net demands in 0) - <span class="math inline">b(N) = 0</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The transshipment problem can be solved simply using linear programming. The general form of the LP is: &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\sum_{ij \in A} w_{ij} x_{ij}</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\sum_{iv \in A} x_{iv} - \sum_{vj \in A} x_{vj} = b_v</span> for all <span class="math inline">v \in N</span>, <span class="math inline">\vec x \ge \vec 0</span>&quot; (the values of <span class="math inline">\vec w</span> and <span class="math inline">\vec b</span> are fixed). In other words, <strong>we're minimizing the total cost of performing the shipments such that we still manage to make inflow minus outflow equal to the net quantity demanded for each individual node</strong>.</p>
<p>In matrix form, the columns are indexed by arcs, and the rows are indexed by nodes. At a given row <span class="math inline">a</span> and column <span class="math inline">ab</span> within the matrix, we put a 0 when there's no such arc, 1 if the digraph contains the arc <span class="math inline">ba</span>, and -1 if the digraph contains the arc <span class="math inline">ab</span>.</p>
<p>Formally, an <strong>incidence matrix</strong> for a digraph <span class="math inline">D = \tup{N, A}</span> is an <span class="math inline">\abs{N}</span> by <span class="math inline">\abs{A}</span> matrix <span class="math inline">M</span> where <span class="math inline">M_{v, ij} = \begin{cases} -1 &amp;\text{if } v = i \\ 1 &amp;\text{if } v = j \\ 0 &amp;\text{otherwise} \end{cases}</span>. As it turns out, the matrix form of the LP for the transshipment problem will always have a coefficients matrix that is the incidence matrix of the digraph, under the assumptions we make for this course.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can write the LP more simply as &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\vec w \cdot \vec x</span> subject to <span class="math inline">M \vec x = \vec b</span>, <span class="math inline">\vec x \ge \vec 0</span>&quot;, where <span class="math inline">M</span> is the incidence matrix for the digraph.</p>
<p>Interestingly, since in an incidence matrix, every column of <span class="math inline">M</span> has exactly one 1 and one -1, or is all 0. Therefore, the sum of all the rows in the matrix gives <span class="math inline">\vec 0</span>. If we sum the <span class="math inline">A \vec x = \vec b</span>, we get <span class="math inline">b(N) = 0</span> - our assumption that the total net quantity demanded is 0.</p>
<p>Consider now the dual for the LP: &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\vec b \cdot \vec y</span> subject to <span class="math inline">M^T \le \vec c</span> for all <span class="math inline">ij \in A</span>, <span class="math inline">\vec y</span> free&quot;, where <span class="math inline">M</span> is the incidence matrix for the digraph. We can then use complementary slackness to show that the LP is optimal.</p>
